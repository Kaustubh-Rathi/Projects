# Projects

Welcome to my project repository! This directory, MY_ALL_PROJECTS, contains a collection of my personal and professional projects. Each sub-directory represents a distinct project with its own goals, technologies, and implementation details. Below is an overview of the projects included in this folder.

## Directory Structure

- *Root Directory*: MY_ALL_PROJECTS

### Projects
1. *convo_newsletter_crew-main*  
   - *Description*: A project that creates a conversational newsletter system using AI or automation to generate and manage content.  

2. *diffbot-kg-chatbot-main*  
   - *Description*: A chatbot built with Diffbot's Knowledge Graph to extract and utilize structured data for conversational tasks.  

3. *LLM-FinetuningBERTforQuestionAnswering-main*  
   - *Description*: A project that fine-tunes BERT, a large language model, for question-answering tasks using NLP techniques.  

4. *MovieMagic*  
   - *Description*: A movie recommendation app powered by machine learning and the KNearestNeighbors algorithm. Built with Streamlit, it provides personalized movie suggestions based on genre or movie name, using the IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. Features a sleek interface and detailed movie information for an enhanced user experience.  

5. *My_Medical_Chatbot*  
   - *Description*: A custom-built medical chatbot designed to assist with healthcare-related queries and provide basic medical advice.  

6. *NETWORK_SECURITY-main*  
   - *Description*: A project focused on network security with tools and techniques for monitoring, protecting, and analyzing network traffic.  

7. *Recommender-System-Collaborative-Filtering-MovieLens*  
   - *Description*: A recommender system built with collaborative filtering techniques, applied to the MovieLens dataset for movie recommendations.  

8. *Species-Flower-Image-Classifier*  
   - *Description*: An image classification project that identifies flower species using machine learning or deep learning models.  

9. *TensorFlow-Federated-Learning*  
   - *Description*: A federated learning project using Flower and TensorFlow to train a MobileNetV2 model for image classification on edge devices like Raspberry Pi. It simulates distributed training across multiple clients to classify images (e.g., head vs. hardhat) and deploys the final model to an Edge Impulse project.  

10. *WINE_QUALITY_PREDICTION_END_TO_END_DEPLOYMENT*  
    - *Description*: An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts wine quality, covering data processing, model training, and deployment.  

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own files, code, and a dedicated README.md with specific instructions. To explore a project:
1. Navigate to the respective sub-directory.
2. Review the contents and accompanying documentation.
3. Follow setup instructions to run or modify the project locally.

## Technologies Used

The projects cover a range of technologies, including:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (e.g., BERT, KNearestNeighbors, MobileNetV2)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Chatbot Development
- Data Science & Predictive Modeling
- Network Security Tools
- Collaborative Filtering Algorithms
- Federated Learning (Flower, TensorFlow)
- Web Frameworks (Streamlit)
- Edge Computing (Edge Impulse, Raspberry Pi)

## Purpose

This directory acts as a centralized hub for my work, showcasing my skills in programming, AI, data science, and distributed systems. Itâ€™s a collection that I update as I explore new ideas and technologies.
